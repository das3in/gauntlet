# GauntletGG

Gauntlet is a self-inputting matchup analysis tool built primarily for Trading
Card Games but it could really be for anything competitive. Create a new match
and watch the relevant data update in front of you. Forewarning: this is a raw
project meant to force me how to think about React and specifically state. The
code will get prettier over time.

## Getting Started

First clone the project `git clone https://github.com/das3in/gauntlet.git`
Then `yarn intall`
And finally `yarn start`

## Running the tests

Those will exist one day. Open to suggestions on how to do that

## Contributing

I'm open to any and all pull-requests. Issues are welcome as well. Specifically PR's
that fix things I'm doing wrong and tests would be great. Love learning by reading
code.
